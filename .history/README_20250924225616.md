## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=8083
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Socket.IO Events

The application uses these Socket.IO events:

- `student:join` - Student joins a poll
- `student:submit` - Student submits their vote
- `poll:update` - Poll state updates (votes, timer, etc.)
- `system:kicked` - Student removal notification
- `chat:message` - Real-time chat messages

## 🎨 Customization

### Theming

The application uses a purple theme defined in `client/global.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 262 83% 58%;        /* Purple primary color */
  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
  /* ... other theme variables */
}
```

### UI Components

All UI components are built with Radix UI and TailwindCSS, located in `client/components/ui/`. These components are fully customizable and follow design system principles.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development Deployment

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### Production Deployment

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Deploy to your preferred platform**:
   - Netlify (recommended)
   - Vercel
   - Railway
   - Heroku

The built application will be in the `dist/` directory.

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Tests are written with Vitest and cover:
- Component rendering
- Socket.IO event handling
- Poll logic validation
- User interaction flows

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated with Zod schemas
- **XSS Protection**: Proper input sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against spam voting
- **Connection Security**: Socket.IO connection validation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Change port in package.json or .env file
   PORT=3001 pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Socket Connection Failed**
   - Check if server is running on correct port
   - Verify firewall settings
   - Ensure WebSocket support in browser

3. **Build Errors**
   ```bash
   # Clear dependencies and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules
   pnpm install
   ```

## 📈 Performance
